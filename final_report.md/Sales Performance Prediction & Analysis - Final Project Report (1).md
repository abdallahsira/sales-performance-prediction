## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 0: Project Planning and Management

**What I did: **

- Created comprehensive project management board in Notion

- Organized tasks, timelines, and deliverables systematically

- Tracked progress through structured workflow

**Project Management Board:** [Build and train prediction models - Notion](https://www.notion.so/20ba4012e53780d79d89ee063a829c7d?v=20ba4012e537807e9e36000c1975d6f8&source=copy_link)

### Step 1: Data Exploration and Preparation

**What I did:**

- Loaded and examined 24 months of sales data (no missing values)

- Analyzed 7 variables: Sales Amount, Marketing Spend, Temperature, Promotion, Season, Region, Month

- Performed statistical analysis and correlation checks

- Identified strong correlations: Sales-Marketing (0.97), Sales-Temperature (0.96)

**Key findings:**

- Sales range: $12,000 - $35,000 (mean: $23,542)

- Marketing spend: $1,700 - $3,500 (mean: $2,521)

- Temperature: 32°F - 80°F (seasonal variation)

### Step 2: Data Visualization and Pattern Analysis

**What I did:**

- Created 6 key visualizations to understand sales patterns

- Analyzed seasonal trends, regional differences, and promotional impact

- Examined relationships between marketing spend, temperature, and sales

**Key insights discovered:**

- Clear seasonal pattern: Summer peaks ($31,000 median), Winter lows ($15,000 median)

- North region outperforms South by ~$4,000

- Strong positive relationship between temperature and sales

- Marketing spend directly correlates with sales performance

### Step 3: Machine Learning Model Development

**What I did:**

- Built and compared three models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Ridge Regression

- Split data: 75% training, 25% testing

- Applied feature scaling for Ridge Regression

- Tested multiple alpha values (0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0)

**Model performance comparison:**

| Model | R² Score | MSE | Rank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ridge Regression (α=0.1)** | **0.9597** | **1,175,106** | **1st** |
| Linear Regression | 0.9531 | 1,365,175 | 2nd |
| Random Forest | 0.9374 | 1,823,033 | 3rd |

### Step 4: Results Interpretation and Insights

**What I did:**

- Analyzed feature importance from the best model (Ridge Regression)

- Identified key business drivers and inhibitors

- Developed actionable recommendations

**Ridge Regression feature importance:**

1. **Temperature**: +$4,367 per degree (strongest driver)

1. **Marketing Spend**: +$670 per dollar (strong ROI)

1. **Season Summer**: +$287 boost

1. **Promotion**: +$183 positive impact

1. **Region South**: -$1,363 disadvantage

1. **Season Winter**: -$778 penalty

### Step 5: Business Recommendations

**Strategic recommendations based on Ridge Regression insights:**

1. **Temperature-Driven Strategy**: Monitor weather forecasts and adjust marketing spend based on temperature predictions

1. **Marketing Optimization**: Increase marketing budget during high-temperature periods for maximum ROI

1. **Seasonal Planning**: Allocate 40% of annual marketing budget to summer months

1. **Regional Focus**: Address South region performance gap through targeted campaigns

1. **Promotion Timing**: Synchronize promotions with high-temperature periods
